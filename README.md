# MIRISim Coronagraphy + JWST Calibration Pipeline Tutorial #

*WARNING* This repository is for my own personal use and is not guaranteed to be updated, bug-free, or appropriate for your use case.

The data are stored here: https://stsci.box.com/s/tk52601kge1rhhcim9kf1al0x2bee4s3

The PSFMASK reference files can be found [here](https://github.com/STScI-MIRI/Gen_PSFMASK_ref_files/tree/main/psf_masks_new). 

The notebook expects the exposures to be stored in a folder called `./data/`, the PSFMASK reference files to be stored in `./psfmasks/`, and for the output to be placed in following three folders: `./output_stage1/`, `./output_stage2/`, and `./output_stage3/`. Parameter configuration files, should you choose to use them, are located in `./parameter_files/`. These locations can all be modified at the appropriate places in the notebook.
